Create a Persistent Volume called `log-volume`. It should make use of a `storage class` name `manual`. It should use `RWX` as the access mode and have a size of `1Gi`. The volume should use the hostPath `/opt/volume/nginx`

Next, create a PVC called `log-claim` requesting a minimum of `200Mi` of storage. This PVC should bind to `log-volume`.

Mount this in a pod called `logger` at the location `/var/www/nginx`. This pod should use the image `nginx:alpine`.
