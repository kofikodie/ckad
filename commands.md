# This code demonstrates the usage of various kubectl commands to manage a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes.

# The `kubectl create` command is used to create a ReplicaSet based on the configuration defined in the "replicaset-definition.yml" file.

# The `kubectl get replicaset` command is used to retrieve information about the existing ReplicaSets in the Kubernetes cluster.

# The `kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset` command is used to delete a specific ReplicaSet named "myapp-replicaset".

# The ``kubectl delete replicationcontrollers myapp-rc` command is used to delete a specific ReplicationController named "myapp-rc".

# The `kubectl replace -f replicaset-definition.yml` command is used to replace an existing ReplicaSet with a new configuration defined in the "replicaset-definition.yml" file.

# The `kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replica` command is used to scale the number of replicas in a ReplicaSet to 6, as specified in the "replica" file.

# Please note that these commands are specific to the Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, and require a running Kubernetes cluster to execute.

# The `kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset` command is used to edit the configuration of a specific ReplicaSet named "myapp-replicaset".

# The `kubectl explain replicaset` command is used to display detailed information about the ReplicaSet resource type, including its fields and properties.

# The `kubectl create -f replicaset-definition.yml` command is used to create a ReplicaSet based on the configuration defined in the "replicaset-definition.yml" file.

# The `kubectl describe quota compute-resources --namespace=myspace` command is used to describe the quota for compute resources in a specific namespace named "myspace" in the Kubernetes cluster.

# The `kubectl exec <pod> -- whoami` command is used to execute the `whoami` command inside a specific pod in the Kubernetes cluster.
