## Storage in a StatefulSet

StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications in Kubernetes. They provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pod creation and deletion. In addition to managing the pods, StatefulSets can also manage the storage for the pods.

To configure storage in a StatefulSet, you can use the `volumeClaimTemplates` field. This field allows you to define the storage requirements for each pod in the StatefulSet.

Here's an example of how to configure storage in a StatefulSet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
    name: my-statefulset
spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: my-app
    serviceName: my-service
    replicas: 3
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: my-app
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: my-container
                    image: my-image
                    volumeMounts:
                        - name: my-volume
                            mountPath: /data
            volumes:
                - name: my-volume
                    persistentVolumeClaim:
                        claimName: my-pvc
    volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
                name: my-pvc
            spec:
                accessModes:
                    - ReadWriteOnce
                resources:
                    requests:
                        storage: 1Gi
```

In this example, we define a StatefulSet with three replicas. Each replica has a container that mounts a persistent volume at the path `/data`. The persistent volume is defined in the `volumeClaimTemplates` field with the name `my-pvc` and a storage request of 1Gi.

By configuring storage in a StatefulSet, you can ensure that each pod in the StatefulSet has its own persistent storage, allowing stateful applications to store and retrieve data across pod restarts.

For more information on StatefulSets and storage configuration, you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id
