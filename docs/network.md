# Network Policy in Kubernetes

Network Policy is a Kubernetes feature that allows you to control the traffic flow between pods in a cluster. It provides a way to define rules for inbound and outbound traffic, allowing you to enforce security and segmentation within your cluster.

To create a Network Policy, you need to define a set of rules that specify which pods can communicate with each other. These rules can be based on various criteria such as pod labels, namespaces, IP addresses, and ports.

By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other. However, with Network Policy, you can restrict this communication based on your specific requirements. For example, you can allow traffic only from certain pods or namespaces, or you can block traffic to specific ports.

Network Policies are implemented using network plugins, such as Calico or Cilium, which provide the necessary functionality to enforce the defined rules. These plugins intercept the network traffic and apply the appropriate policies based on the rules defined in the Network Policy.

To create a Network Policy, you need to define it in a YAML file and apply it to your cluster using the `kubectl` command. Once applied, the network plugin will enforce the specified rules, ensuring that only allowed traffic is allowed between pods.

Network Policies are a powerful tool for securing and isolating your Kubernetes workloads. By defining and enforcing network rules, you can enhance the security and reliability of your cluster.

## Creating a Network Policy

To create a Network Policy in Kubernetes, you need to define a Network Policy manifest file. Here's an example of a simple Network Policy that allows traffic only from pods with the label `app=frontend`:

````yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
spec:
    podSelector:
        matchLabels:
        app: frontend
    policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
    ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            app: frontend
          namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
            project: myproject
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.5.10/32
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
    egress:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
            app: frontend
          namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
            project: myproject
        ports:
        - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
````

In this example, INGRESS the Network Policy `allow-frontend` allows traffic only from pods with the label `app=frontend` and traffic from pods in the namespace with the label `project=myproject`. It also allows traffic from the IP address `192.168.5.10/32` on port 80. The EGRESS Network Policy allows traffic to pods with the label `app=frontend` and traffic to pods in the namespace with the label `project=myproject` on port 80.


## Managing Network Policies

Once you have created a Network Policy, you can manage it using the Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`). Here are some common operations:

- To create a Network Policy from a YAML file: `kubectl create -f networkpolicy.yaml`
- To view the status of a Network Policy: `kubectl get networkpolicies`
- To view the details of a specific Network Policy: `kubectl describe networkpolicy allow-frontend`
- To delete a Network Policy: `kubectl delete networkpolicy allow-frontend`

By managing Network Policies, you can control the traffic flow between pods in your Kubernetes cluster and enforce security policies to protect your workloads. Network Policies are a key component of Kubernetes networking and provide granular control over how pods communicate with each other.
