# Storage Class in Kubernetes

A Storage Class in Kubernetes is an object that defines the type of storage that can be dynamically provisioned for PersistentVolumes (PVs). It provides a way to abstract the underlying storage infrastructure and allows users to request storage without having to know the details of the underlying storage implementation.

To create a Storage Class, you need to define the following properties:

- `provisioner`: Specifies the name of the storage provisioner that will be used to dynamically provision the PersistentVolumes.
- `parameters`: Optional parameters that can be passed to the storage provisioner.
- `reclaimPolicy`: Specifies what happens to the PersistentVolume when it is released. The options are `Retain`, `Delete`, or `Recycle`.
- `volumeBindingMode`: Specifies how PersistentVolumes should be bound to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). The options are `Immediate` or `WaitForFirstConsumer`.

Once a Storage Class is created, users can request storage by creating PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and referencing the Storage Class in the `storageClassName` field.

Example Storage Class definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
    name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
    type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

In the above example, the Storage Class is named "fast" and it uses the AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) provisioner with the `gp2` storage type. The `reclaimPolicy` is set to `Retain`, which means the PersistentVolume will not be deleted when released. The `volumeBindingMode` is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`, which means the PersistentVolume will be bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim only when a Pod is scheduled that references the PVC.

By using Storage Classes, Kubernetes provides a flexible and dynamic way to manage storage in a cluster, allowing users to easily request and provision storage resources as needed.
